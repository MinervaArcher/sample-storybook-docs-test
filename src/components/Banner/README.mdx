# Banner

Banners communicate critical, time-sensitive messaging about loss of data,
functionality or other system-level issues that might affect a user’s ability
to use the site or application.

Banners should appear directly above the navigation bar to ensure important
changes or persistent conditions are prominently displayed to the user.
Because they relate to the whole system or application, they exist at the
highest level of the page’s hierarchy.

## How to Import

```jsx
import { Banner } from 'design-system';
```

## Included Resources

### Variants

- `Banner.Variants.ERROR`
- `Banner.Variants.WARNING` (default)

## Example Usage

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Banner>
    Some content is slow or failing to publish.
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

```jsx
<Banner>
  Some content is slow or failing to publish.
</Banner>
```

## Variants

A Banner's color and icon communicate the level of severity of a message.
By default, Banners communicate warnings.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story name="default">
    <Banner>
      Some users are reporting trouble connecting to Scoop due to a regional internet outage. If you
      are affected, consider using your phone as a mobile hotspot to connect to the internet.
    </Banner>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

```jsx
<Banner>
  Some users are reporting trouble connecting to Scoop due to a regional internet outage. If you are
  affected, consider using your phone as a mobile hotspot to connect to the internet.
</Banner>
```

However, they can also communicate errors for more severe or urgent issues.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story name="error">
    <Banner variant={Banner.Variants.ERROR}>Everything is on fire</Banner>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

```jsx
<Banner variant={Banner.Variants.ERROR}>Everything is on fire</Banner>
```

## Best Practices

### Multiple concurrent banners

In rare instances, multiple system-level announcements may need to appear
at once. These situations should be avoided whenever possible to prevent users
from becoming overwhelmed with potentially alarming messages. However, if the
need arises for multiple banners to appear at once, the banners should stack
above the navbar.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story name="multiple banners">
    <div>
      <Banner variant={Banner.Variants.WARNING}>No internet connection</Banner>
      <Banner variant={Banner.Variants.ERROR}>
        We are experiencing a service outage.
      </Banner>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

```jsx
<div>
  <Banner variant={Banner.Variants.WARNING}>No internet connection</Banner>
  <Banner variant={Banner.Variants.ERROR}>
    We are experiencing a service outage.
  </Banner>
</div>
```
